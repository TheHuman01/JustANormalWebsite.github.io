		<h1>Have you ever wanted to make a model railroad but don't know were to start?</h1>
		<h4>(Or you are the .5% of people who are scared of trains so you thought a tiny model train would be better)</h4>

		<h3>What Scale?</h3>
	</body>
	<p>Model railroads are these easy things that you can just buy a train with some tracks, right? Well there are a few other this you have to worry about. First, the are 6 different scales you can use. HO, O, and N ar the most common, but there is also S, Z, And Go3. So you are probably wonder what scale I use(or you are wondering whats for dinner) but if you were wondering I use HO scale, which is a 1:86 scale to the real world. It is small enough to make a small railroad without using to much space, and it is big enough you dont need a microscope to see what you are doing. So you need to choose what scale you use wisely.<p1>

	<h3>What Time Period?</h3>

	<p>There are a few major time peroids that you can recreate. Early steam, early dissel, and modern are some of the most common time periods to recreate. It is very important to stick with your time period, and if you are going for realism, it is VERY important. If you have a steam engine fling past a modern train station will look out of place. Planning ahead will help with that, but we will get to that later(or not, it's whatever I am feeling)</p>

	<h3>What Region?</h3>
